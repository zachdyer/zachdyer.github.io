In 2009 I met a friend of my sister named David Hairabedian.
He was the marketing director for Pheonix Web and he had 5 or 6 current projects that were in the works.
However Pheonix Web went out of business and could not complete the projects.
I  was developing online interactive childrens books for Bible Rhymes.
I shared my work with David and he was impressed with it.

He ask me to finish a website for his client SouthLaw from Overland Park.
Those were the days when Flash was all the rage and I had experience with Flash working on Bible Rhymes.
So I built the site with Flash and HTML.
I used Flash for the menu and header and I used iframes and html for the content.
David and SouthLaw liked how the site turned out and David continued to work with me building sites for many of his clients for a few years.
